<p align="center">Launch builds and start simulators from your menu bar</p>

Orbit is a menu bar app designed to make your development workflow even faster, allowing you to launch builds and run Snack projects on your devices and simulators with ease. At this point in time, Orbit is only compatible with macOS but we have exciting plans to integrate it further into the Expo ecosystem and add even more features. Try out Expo Orbit now, explore its capabilities, and share your feedback. Your input will shape the future of this tool and guide us on where to take it next.

## Install

You can download Orbit from [orbit/releases](https://github.com/expo/eas-menu-bar/releases) or via Homebrew:

```sh
brew install expo-orbit
```

If you want Orbit to automatically start when you log in, click on the Orbit icon in the menu bar, then "Settings" and select the "Launch on Login" option.
